Baishakhi Log Parser notes:

config.ini file specifies the database connection informaiton (currently set to Baishakhi)

Use ghLogDb.py

From main test we create a ghLogDb object which starts with a log file name and sets
a current project, method to none and records list of has.

ghLogDb object:
Methods:
__str__
isSha -> determine if line is SHA? (uses regular expression + commit key)
isAuthor -> determine if this is the author line and extract the “Author:” field.
isDate -> determine if line is the date line.
createPatchWithNoPrevVersion -> identifies and creates a Patch object for a new file.
createPatch -> identifies and creates a Patch object for an existing file.
processPatch -> Given a patch object and a line, determines if we have a new patch to create, or 
processLog ->

Patch object:
-has fileName, and language, test marker and list of methods.

I think the issue might be in the git diff command itself.
